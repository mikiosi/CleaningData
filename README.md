# CleaningData
Following are the insutrctions followed to complete the assignment and below are the steps in details.
## Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
## 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
## 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
## 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

 # Merge the training and test sets to create one data set 

  # create 'x' data set 

 # create 'y' data set 

 # create 'subject' data set 


 # Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 

 # get only columns with mean() or std() in their names 

 # subset the desired columns 

 # correct the column names 
 
 # Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
 
 # update values with correct activity names 

 # correct column name 

 # Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names 

 # correct column name 

 # bind all the data in a single data set 

 # Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
